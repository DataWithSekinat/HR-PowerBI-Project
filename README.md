# HR-PowerBI-Project
An interactive Power BI dashboard providing insights into employee distribution, attrition trends, and performance metrics to support HR decision making.

## Description 
This HR Attrition Analysis project uses Power BI to visualize and analyze employee attrition trends within a fictional company. It provides actionable insights into workforce dynamics, helping HR and management make data-driven decisions to improve retention, satisfaction, and performance.

## Overview 
Employee turnover is a critical HR challenge. This dashboard explores how factors like age, job role, performance, and salary impact attrition. The data is visualized to uncover patterns and trends that explain why employees leave and how the organization can retain its best talent.
